                        Streptococcus pneumoniae(the pneumococcus) is the leading bacterial cause of respiratory diseases including ear, nose, throat and lung infections. This bacterium is particularly problematic in children and the elderly. Dr Dube is collecting data on specific strains of pneumococcus infecting a cohort of young children in the Cape Town at different stages of their life. In this project, you will develop software to support this research, enabling researchers to load new data, store data and visualize this multi-dimensional data set. The visualization should enable an overview of the data, as well as focus on specific subsets and filtering.

                        <p>Felix Dube is a medical microbiologist with broader research interests in the microbial dysbiosis associated with infectious diseases. The current focus is on Streptococcus pneumoniae (the ‘pneumococcus’), a bacterium that is a major bacterial cause of diseases including pneumonia and meningitis worldwide. By applying high-throughput genome sequencing techniques, this work provides further insights into the pneumococcal pathobiome, especially changes in pneumococcal sero-epidemiology, pathogenesis through statistical and computational approaches to unravel genotype-phenotype associations. This work is interfaced with an in-depth characterization of the nasopharyngeal resistome in children colonized by pneumococci.  A recent but rapidly expanding component of our research group is around the evolution of the microbiome at different body sites in African children and the relationship between the microbiome and child health, with a specific focus on respiratory and skin infections and on antimicrobial resistance.</p>
